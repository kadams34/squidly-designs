            <img src="pwp-persona.jpg" alt="Young, Artsy Customer">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name:</strong> Sadie Spencer</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> 25</li>
                <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Sadie is a student studying art history, a server at a locally owned breakfast and
                    lunch diner, and  a volunteer at a local animal shelter.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> mobile- iPhone 11  laptop: 2019 MacBook Pro  OS: macOS Catalina</li>
                <li><strong>Behaviors & Attitudes:</strong> Sadie LOVES animals of all kinds. Lives downtown in a loft with her boyfriend. Always
                    shops local and prefers to steer clear of corporate entities and chains. Prefers sustainable, organic(if possible),
                    and handmade products and crafts. Shops at outdoor farmer's markets as often as possible. Has a very busy schedule with
                    work, school, and her volunteer work, but makes a point to support local artists, music, and other events that
                    benefit her community.</li>
                <li><strong>Frustrations & Needs:</strong> May is a very busy celebration month for her family. 2 birthdays in total, not
                    including her own, with Mother's Day as well. With finals at school coming up, a busier schedule at the diner from the warming weather, and no
                    desire to buy mass produced products, finding gifts for her family members' birthdays and Mother's Day will be a challenge. </li>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Sadie's goal for using this site will be to find a gift that suits her family members'
                    personalities. Sadie, as well as her family, loves animals and every family member has a pet or pets of their
                    own. While shopping at the Downtown Albuquerque's Grower's Market, she stumbled upon Squidly Designs' booth and really
                    enjoyed Jennifer's art. After taking Jennifer's card and following Squidly Designs on Instagram, she saw the option
                    for personalized pet portraits. This website will allow her to place an order for a personalized drawing of each of
                    her family members' pets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a new user, Sadie needs to place an inquiry for a personalized art commission.</p>
