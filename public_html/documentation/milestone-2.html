                description of the site's purpose: custom art commissions.</p>

                her love of animals. A picture of Jennifer in her art booth will highlight the section. This will help the

            <p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>Several examples of Jennifer's pet portraits. Each image will have a description
                highlighting the style of the portrait, giving the customer more options.</p>

                Each submission is unique, requiring direct communication from Jennifer to the client.</p>
