        <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
        <section>
            <p>This site will be a single page with the following sections:</p>
            <h2>Header/Banner: </h2>
            <p>A custom banner containing the Squidly Designs name brand, logo, and a short
                description of the site's purpose: custom art commissions.</p>
            <h2>About Me: </h2>
            <p>A brief write-up on Jennifer Hernandez containing a small bio with an emphasis on her love of animals. A
                picture of Jennifer in her art booth and a photo of her home studio will highlight the section. This
                will help the potential customer feel closer to the artist and put a face to the creator of the
                personalized portrait.</p>
            <h2>Portfolio: </h2>
            <p>Several examples of Jennifer's previously commissioned pet portraits. Each image will have a brief
                description highlighting the style of the portrait, giving the customer more options and ideas.</p>
            <h2>Contact: </h2>
            <p>A contact form for the potential customer to submit an inquiry for a commission.
                This will include name, contact info, a textarea to describe what they are looking for, and an option
                to submit a photo of their pet. Each submission is unique, requiring direct communication with Jennifer
                to make a truly unique portrait and experience.</p>
